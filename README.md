# TypeScript Kata Starter

Doing [kata](http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/2012/05/02/kata-the-only-way-to-learn-tdd/) is fun!

There are [lots of them](https://kata-log.rocks/tdd).

## Get Started

1. Fork or download this repo.
2. Run `npm i` to install things.
3. Run `npm t` to test.
4. Delete my nonsense function.
5. Do a kata.

## Get Started Again

Time-boxed is the way to do kata. Before you start a new one,
    run `git reset --hard origin/master`
